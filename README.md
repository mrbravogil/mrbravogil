## 🎨 What Drives Me

With a background in design, I approach software as both a technical craft and a creative experience. I’m driven by how **psychology, visual language, and user behavior** shape the way people interact with digital products.

I enjoy turning ideas into intuitive interfaces and clean architectures — where **creativity meets logic** and every detail has a purpose. My goal is to build software that not only works well, but also feels right.
